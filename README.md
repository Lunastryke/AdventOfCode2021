# Advent Of Code 2021
Repo for code solutions for Advent of Code challenge 2021
- Solutions are done in a mixture of Python and C++ and maybe some other languages
- I'm pretty familiar with Python but for C++ still abit foreign, especially for the Object-Oriented Programming part (Last time I did OOP it was in Java)
- Challenges are done to practise my programming skills! May not be the best implementation of the solution

## Summary of challenges
- Day 1 : `Python` : Pretty straightforward challenge
- Day 2 : `Python` : Pretty straightforward challenge
- Day 3 : `Python` : Pretty straightforward challenge
- Day 4 : `Python` : Slightly more challenging, lined all bingo boards in a 1D array and used their indexes to identify which board they were
- Day 5 :  `C++` : Input parsing of strings were the major issue here, also vector manipulation was slightly troublesome
- Day 6 : `C++` : Interesting problem, used OOP at first but ran out of ram on 2nd part so had to change approach
