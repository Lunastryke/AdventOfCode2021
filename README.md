# Advent Of Code 2021
Repo for code solutions for Advent of Code challenge 2021
- Solutions are done in a mixture of Python and C++ and maybe some other languages
- I'm pretty familiar with Python but for C++ still abit foreign, especially for the Object-Oriented Programming part (Last time I did OOP it was in Java)
- Challenges are done to practise my programming skills! May not be the best implementation of the solution

## Summary of challenges
- Day 1 : `Python` : Pretty straightforward challenge
- Day 2 : `Python` : Pretty straightforward challenge
- Day 3 : `Python` : Pretty straightforward challenge
- Day 4 : `Python` : Slightly more challenging, lined all bingo boards in a 1D array and used their indexes to identify which board they were
- Day 5 : `C++` : Input parsing of strings were the major issue here, also vector manipulation was slightly troublesome
- Day 6 : `C++` : Interesting problem, used OOP at first but ran out of ram on 2nd part so had to change approach
- Day 7 : `C++` : DP problem
- Day 8 : `C++/Python` : Quite a tedious challenge, draw a tree to split cases and narrow down digits to solve
- Day 9 : `Python` : DFS floodfill, to read up more about the use of Reduce
- Day 10 : `Python` : Braces matching, dict to map open braces to closed braces and to score. Middle element of array is len(array)//2 not len(array)//2 + 1!!
- Day 11 : `Python` : Similar to Day 9, DFS floodfill with different 'visited' condition
- Day 12 : `Python` : DFS, interesting method to do DFS, currently stuck at Part 2 with the current implementation
- Day 13 : `Python` : Pretty straightfoward challenge, probably can optimise memory usage
- Day 14 : `Python` : Part 1 was done naively, Part 2 ran out of time so decided to maintain only pair counts and mappings instead which worked well. Also did it in OOP fashion, will do the rest of the AoC challenges in a similar fashion.
